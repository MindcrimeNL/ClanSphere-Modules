* It doesn't work at all! What is wrong?
First of all check if you have created database and replays directories and if
their names are correct (the same as in example.php). If the script still
doesn't work make sure that PHP has zlib support.

* I get some "Notice: (...)" messages. How can I get rid of them?
Set error reporting to the default value in your php.ini
error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
Or add the following line to example.php:
error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE);

* Can I use the parser on my site without any restrictions?
Yes, as long as you put a link to the parser's homepage on your site.
